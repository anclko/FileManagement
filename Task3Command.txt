I decided to implement the delete command.

To use the delete, it will do what it does for the other commands first and check if there are enough
arguments in the command line (so if it was written as: 'the command + the file name you want to delete)

It first checks if the command has a command and the name of a file by checking the size of the input (what is written in cmd). If not. it returns an error.

It will then get the file name to delete from the 1st position in the command line
the command is at 0 position

It then creates an instance of the file name called file.

It then checks that the file exists with "exists" and if it exists it goes ahead
and deletes the file with the "delete" and if successful, prints a confirmation.

Theres also exception handling if the file cant be deleted or if the file doesnt exist.
